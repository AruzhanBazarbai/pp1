//Rayan has a two-dimensional array with n rows and m columns. He wants to estimate the quality of the
//array with respect to some number x.
//Quality of a two-dimensional array with respect to x is calculated as the number of rows in the array that
//contains number x in them.
//Given a two-dimensional array and a number x, can you help Rayan with calculating the arrayâ€™s quality
//with respect to x?
