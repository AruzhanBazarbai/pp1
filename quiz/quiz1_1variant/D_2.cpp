//Problem D. Where is the money Lebowski?
//Daniilâ€™s money was stolen by Lebowski. Since Daniil is a professional hacker, he wants to know where his
//money is. After hacking, he received 4 numbers: a, n, b, k. If the n-th bit of the number a is equal to the
//k-th bit of the number b, he will find his money. Help him write a program.
