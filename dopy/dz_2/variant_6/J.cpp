/*
Oma is a student at KBTU. Everyday he uses subway to get to the university. By his assumptions, this
month he is going to ride the subway n times. Each ride costs him x tenge. Also, as he discovered, there
is a ticket that he can use for a whole months which he can buy at a price y tenge. If he buys this ticket,
instead of paying for every ride x (totally n âˆ— x) tenge, he will pay only y tenge.
Can you help him to make a decision which minimizes his wastes?
